# First Experience

Everybody starts somewhere. I'm using this repo to keep track of what I did during my first experience so that I can recall it for myself and share it with others.

Well "first experience". What I mean is linux as a daily driver for my laptop.

The basics of using terminal and installing programs are known.

# Specs

Distro: Linux Mint (Cinnamon)
Device: ThinkPad T450s

# After Install

Read the 'Welcome Window'. It contains useful information such as basic appearance settings up to important stuff as Uptade/Driver manager.
Take your time reading it as it's pretty importand I would say.

Other interesting settings can be made in "system settings". Changing applets for the bar, change system fonts and much more.

## Neofetch

Program to print current "stats" out of the terminal. Useful to see what the basic Mint install uses and it looks good

## Kitty terminal emulator

Took it because I don't know why, better than default I guess. Got a few config options. As I like the theme of Catppuccin, I took the config of it from their repo.

I added basics as fonts and opacity not much more.

# Lazygit

Seen this program used by others and I plan on using git more so I looked into it.

Currently I am also using this to upload to this repo (I can only recommend it).

# Starship

A shell prompt to make the text in the terminal look more fancy.
Took a setup from somebody that looked good(github -> search for filename "starship.toml), changed some stuff and then ran with it.

My config is based on [this guys config](https://github.com/w3samiulazim/garuda-starship.toml/blob/25d882253d24ad76e264363b68755968a03a6455/starship.toml)

## Vim/NeoVim

~~Currently still using vim, though planning on switching to neovim the next few days.~~

Installed neovim. I am currently using the vim-plug plugin manager. It's pretty easy to setup.
