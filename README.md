# First Experience

Everybody starts somewhere. Im using this repo to keep track of what i did during my first experience so that i can recall it for my self and share it with others.

Well "first experience". What i mean is linux as a daily driver for my laptop.

The basics of using terminal and installing programs are known.

# Specs

Distro: Linux Mint (Cinnamon)
Device: ThinkPad T450s

# After Install

Read the 'Welcome Window'. It contains useful information such as basic appearance settings up to important stuff as Uptade/Driver manager.
Take your time reading it as it's pretty importand i would say.

Other interesting settings can be made in "system settings". Changing applets for the bar, change system fonts and much more.

## Neofetch

Program to print current "stats" out of the terminal. Useful to see what the basic Mint install uses and it looks good

## Kitty terminal emulator

Took it because idk why, better than default i guess. Got a few config options. As i like the theme of Catppuccin, i took the config of it from their repo.

I added basics as fonts and opacity not much more.

## Vim/NeoVim

Currently still using vim, though planning on switching to neovim the next few days

## Basic Programs

1. Discord
2. YouTube Music
3. Thunderbird Mail (Preinstalled)
4. htop (terminal based resource monitor)
